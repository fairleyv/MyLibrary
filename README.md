No install necessary. 

## Usage 

You can submit your search in the search bar at the top of the index page and the top ten search results will populate on the page. If logged in then each title will have a "Save This Book" button if the title isn't a part of your library and a message stating that the book has already been saved if it is a part of your library. In order to view your saved books you must click on the "saved books" link on the top left corner and you'll be redirected to a page with all of your saved titles.
